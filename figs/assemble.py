Assemble the per-panel PDFs into a composite figure.

`figures-mimic-mjx` stops at one PDF per panel and assembles by hand in Illustrator.
This does that step in code so the whole figure is reproducible end to end, while
keeping the per-panel PDFs as the primary artefact -- they are still the thing you
open in Illustrator when you want to nudge something by eye.

HOW IT WORKS. Each panel PDF is embedded as VECTOR content via PyMuPDF's
`show_pdf_page`, not rasterised, so type stays live and editable downstream and the
composite carries exactly the strokes the panel scripts drew. Panel letters are set
in Helvetica-Bold, metric-compatible with Arial and one of the base-14 fonts every
PDF consumer has, so the letters match the panels' body type without embedding a
second family.

LAYOUT IS BY ROWS, NOT BY COORDINATES, and that is deliberate. Only each panel's
WIDTH is specified; its height follows from its own aspect ratio, and each row is
placed below the tallest panel of the row above it. Hand-written y coordinates were
tried first and produced exactly the failure you would expect -- Fig 1's tall 3D
panel ran into the tool table below it, and Fig 7's axis labels ran into the next
row's legend -- because the author of the layout does not know how tall
`bbox_inches="tight"` made a panel. Nothing here can overlap.

Nature's double-column width is 180 mm, single column 88 mm. Keep the finished
artwork under ~200 mm so a caption still fits on a 247 mm page; `assemble()` warns
when a figure exceeds that.
